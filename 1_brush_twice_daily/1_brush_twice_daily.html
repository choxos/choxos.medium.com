<p>For the following PECO question:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>P</strong>opulation: All ages</p></li>
<li><p><strong>E</strong>xposure: Frequent toothbrushing (at least once daily on average)</p></li>

<td>Risk of Bias</td>
<td>Not serious</td>
<td>Studies with the most weights in meta-analysis (Vanobbergen 2001, Hausen 1981, and Bernabe 2012) are of high quality in selection bias and overall (Appendix Table 4). Also, meta-regression shows that overall quality of the studies had negligble influence on the results of the meta-analysis. Therefore, it’s unlikely that the results of meta-analysis was influenced by risk of bias of the included studies and we can conclude that bias is not a serious concern for this outcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Inconsistency</td>
<td>Not serious</td>
<td>There are variations in point estimates across studies, and confidence intervals do not entirely overlap. The I<sup>2</sup> value is not large, however (31%, P=0.12). The heterogeneity can be explained by subgroups since I<sup>2</sup>=0 in the second subgroup of the meta-analysis. But the heterogeneity in the first subgroup still exists, though not high (45%, P=0.07). Therefore, there are no serious concerns in this domain.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Indirectness</td>
<td>Not serious</td>
<td><p>The majority of the studies were conducted among &lt;18-year-olds. Exposure and outcome aligns with our question of interest.</p>
<p>However, studies were different in sample size, follow-up period, and caries diagnosis level (cavitated or non-cavitated). The meta-regression results in Appendix Table 5 shows that these factors were not influential. The third meta-analysis in Figure 4 also shows that the results were similar for decidiuous and permanent dentitions (Odds: 1.75 vs 1.39) which can imply that the effect of age was also negligible. So, we can conclude no serious concerns for this domain.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Imprecision</td>
<td>Not serious</td>
<td><p>The sample size is not shown in the forest plot but a quick glance at Appendix Table 3 confirms that the number of participants in the meta-analysis is higher than the optimal information size.</p>
<p>The confidence interval doesn’t cross the null value (1.50, 95% CI: 1.34–1.69). Therefore, there are no serious concerns in this domain.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Publication bias</td>
<td>Undetected</td>
<td>We have a sufficient number of studies to assess publication bias through a funnel plot (more than the minimum of 10). The funnel plot (Figure 5) does not appear to be asymmetric and, in fact, includes some studies on the left-hand side, which does not favour frequent toothbrushing. Additionally, they conducted a comprehensive search across multiple sources (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and CINAHL from database inception). They also captured small studies with small effects. Therefore, we can say publication bias is undetected in this case.</td>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overall-certainty-of-evidence">Overall certainty of evidence</h2>
<p>Since this meta-analysis includes observational studies, the certainty of evidence starts with “Low”. The effect doesn’t seem to be large (OR=1.50), and there is no dose-response gradient (between 1 and 2 thresholds). Therefore, the overall certainty of evidence remains to be <strong>Low</strong>.</p>
